# QuickRent Landing Page

## Brief Description
QuickRent is a platform that allows users to easily rent gadgets with flexible pricing, fast delivery, and easy returns. This landing page showcases the features of the platform and provides an intuitive navigation system for users to learn more about the service.

### Approach
The landing page was built using **React.js** to create a dynamic and responsive layout. The page includes a **hero section** with a call-to-action button, **features** of the platform, and **testimonials** from satisfied users. The design follows modern UI principles with dark gradient colors, smooth hover effects, and a clean, aesthetically pleasing layout.
